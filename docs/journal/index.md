## `2022.07.07` First Blood
<hr/>

This is my first journal entry.  My name is Robert Devitt.  I created devitt.dev
as a barebones, fast-loading site to provide a simple front-facing site for my
software development business.

While you may notice it is not the "fanciest" site, it is surely intentional:
oftentimes the engineer or builder eventually finds beauty in simpler creations.

I have created several personal business sites in the past using `Wordpress`.  For
anyone with experience with `Wordpress`, you will know the experience can degrade
very quickly as themes, plugins, and the `Wordpress` foundation itself becomes
outdated.

While I theorize this may be intentional to "force" the economy, it is not conducive
to happy website owners who would like more confidence that their business site
will last more than a year.

I believe the future is in `SPAs` and `SSGs`, or a blend of the two.  They are
fast-loading, unbloated, and small in filesize when designed correctly.

I hope to add more projects in the near future using `Next.js` in combination with
a headless CMS.

Additionally, I hope to showcase more machine learning and AI projects here on
the journal.

Thank you for reading,
Robert
