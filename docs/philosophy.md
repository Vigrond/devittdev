# Philosophy

DD Believes in the following approach to software development:

*  **Modern Methods with Modern Technology**

    Software is an ever-changing field, and it changes fast.  Modern tech requires
    modern methods, strategies, and workflows.  This requires staying up to date
    on the latest industry trends.

*  **Documentation and Requirements**

    Project trajectory is often determined by the quality and specificity of documentation.

    These two items should be held to the highest standard.

*  **Transparency**

    It is the nature of technical work to give way to uncertainty for those
    on the outside.

    Clients will always have access to time logs, current activity, code repositories,
    and internal technical documentation.

*  **Testing**

    Confidence in the project is reinforced heavily by rigorous testing.  Testing
    proves the project is meeting its goals and requirements.

    Employing both Unit Testing and Functional Testing flows is essential to a
    successful project.

*  **Iteration**

    Iteration conveys the cyclic process of high quality software development.

    In early stages, it is the process of refining the project requirements combined
    with continuous-feedback from the client.

    In development stages, it is code reviews, testing, and documentation.

    In support stages, it is end-user feedback, server maintenance, security, and
    error tracking.

    An iterative approach is crucial to positive client, end-user, and developer experience.
